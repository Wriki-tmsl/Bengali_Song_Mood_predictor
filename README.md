# Bengali_Song_Mood_predictor

Key Components
Custom Dataset: To ensure accuracy and relevance, we meticulously curated a custom dataset of Bengali songs, each meticulously labeled with specific emotions, including happiness, sadness, and more. This handcrafted dataset forms the backbone of our mood prediction model.

Python Libraries: Leveraging the power of Python, we harnessed various libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, and Pickle to construct and train the model. These industry-standard tools enabled us to unlock the full potential of our project.

Web App: To provide a user-friendly experience, we created a local web app where users can explore the emotions of their favorite Bengali songs effortlessly. For seamless functionality, the system requires the scaler save file (scaler.pkl), the saved model file (my_model), and the dataset file (dataset.csv).
